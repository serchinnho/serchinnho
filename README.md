### Hi ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a RL model to train an AI on a Nintendo game. First, it's probably gonna be Mario Bros., then later I'll tackle Pokemon.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to use platforms such as this one. I'm also honing my ML skills. I need to work on hyperparameters.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with people interested on client segmentation and classic ML models.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding more things to learn and improve on in the Data Science world! I'm really passionate about it!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about a project you're interested in and I can give my two cents

ðŸ“« How to reach me: Well, you're in my profile already, so you're half-way there!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him.

âš¡ Fun fact: I still love the academia and used to teach there! My formation is Mathematics but I've recently been drawn in Data Science!
